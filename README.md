## Quick Start

1. **Pick the bots you need** from the 3 above. Most servers want all three.
2. **Click any "Add" link** above to invite the bot.
3. **Setup bot:** run `/setup` to build your server from a template.
4. **Anime bot:** create a channel called `#new-episodes` and the release feed auto-posts.
5. **Tools bot:** run `/monitor add <url>` to track a website's uptime.

No accounts, no dashboard, no payment. Each bot DMs the server owner with onboarding info on join.

## Why Three Bots?

The original NIX Bot grew to 30+ commands and started doing too much. Splitting into three:
- **Smaller permission scopes** — admins grant each bot only what it needs
- **Failure isolation** — one bot crashing doesn't take down the others
- **Cleaner help** — each bot's `/help` shows just its own commands
- **Install what you want** — don't need anime stuff? Skip NIX Anime
